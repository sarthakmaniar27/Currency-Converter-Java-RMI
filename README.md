Implemented a Currency Converter by using the concept of Java RMI . It has currencies of different Countries and after inputting the amount it displays the converted amount into Indian currency (INR). 
It also contains a basic GUI made using Java Swings.


The RMI (Remote Method Invocation) is an API that provides a mechanism to create distributed application in java. 

The RMI allows an object to invoke methods on an object running in another JVM.
